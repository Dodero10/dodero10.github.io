# Desert Dreams: Two Weeks Road Tripping Through the American Southwest

**Published: May 25, 2023**

There's something magical about the American Southwest—red rock formations that seem from another planet, vast skies that stretch forever, and that distinct desert light photographers chase at dawn and dusk. Last month, my partner and I embarked on a 14-day road trip through Arizona, Utah, and New Mexico. Here's our route, highlights, and practical advice for anyone planning a similar adventure.

## Planning the Perfect Southwest Road Trip

### Our Route Overview

We drove a 1,500-mile loop starting and ending in Las Vegas (cheapest car rental):

1. Las Vegas, NV → Sedona, AZ (4.5 hours)
2. Sedona → Grand Canyon South Rim (2 hours)
3. Grand Canyon → Page, AZ (2.5 hours)
4. Page → Monument Valley (2 hours)
5. Monument Valley → Moab, UT (3 hours)
6. Moab → Santa Fe, NM (5.5 hours)
7. Santa Fe → Taos, NM (1.5 hours)
8. Taos → Las Vegas, NV (9 hours, with stops)

### When to Go

We traveled in late April/early May and found it ideal:

- **Spring (April-May)**: Comfortable temperatures, wildflowers, smaller crowds
- **Fall (September-October)**: Beautiful light, cooling temperatures
- **Winter (November-March)**: Potential snow, fewer crowds, lower prices
- **Summer (June-August)**: Extremely hot (100°F+), but dramatic monsoon storms

### Vehicle Choice

We opted for a mid-size SUV with decent clearance:

- Handled unpaved roads to more remote areas
- Comfortable for long driving days
- Better visibility for landscape viewing
- Not a gas-guzzler (important with desert distances)

## Sedona: Red Rock Magic (Days 1-3)

Sedona's red rock formations are even more stunning in person than in photographs.

### Hiking Highlights

- **Cathedral Rock Trail**: Short but steep climb with incredible views (go at sunset)
- **Devil's Bridge**: Iconic natural arch (go early to avoid crowds)
- **Boynton Canyon**: Longer hike with diverse ecosystems and vortex energy

### Beyond Hiking

- Took a Pink Jeep Tour to areas we couldn't reach otherwise
- Visited Tlaquepaque Arts & Shopping Village for local artwork
- Enjoyed stargazing at night (Sedona is a Dark Sky Community)
- Tried prickly pear margaritas at Elote Cafe

## Grand Canyon: Humbling Perspectives (Days 4-5)

No matter how many photos you've seen, nothing prepares you for the scale of the Grand Canyon.

### South Rim Experiences

- Watched sunrise at Mather Point (arrived 30 minutes before dawn)
- Hiked part of the South Kaibab Trail (we went to Skeleton Point)
- Took the shuttle to different viewpoints along Hermit Road
- Attended a ranger talk about canyon geology

### Practical Tips

- Stay in the park if possible (we booked 6 months in advance)
- The temperature drops 25°F as you descend into the canyon
- Always carry more water than you think you need
- Don't attempt to hike rim-to-river and back in one day

## Page and Lake Powell: Water in the Desert (Day 6)

### Antelope Canyon

We booked a photography tour of Lower Antelope Canyon:

- More intimate and less crowded than Upper Canyon
- Light beams occur mid-day (11am-1pm) when the sun is highest
- Guides know exactly where to point your camera for the best shots

### Horseshoe Bend

Just a 10-minute drive from Page:

- Short 1.5-mile round-trip hike to the viewpoint
- Best photographed late afternoon when the light is softer
- Bring a wide-angle lens if you're a photographer

## Monument Valley: Icon of the West (Day 7)

Staying at The View Hotel was worth every penny:

- Each room faces the Mittens (famous rock formations)
- Watched sunrise from our balcony
- Took a Navajo-guided tour to restricted areas
- Learned about indigenous history and cultural significance

## Moab: Adventure Base (Days 8-10)

Moab deserves at least three days to explore its two national parks:

### Arches National Park

- Hiked to Delicate Arch for sunset (2.5-mile round trip)
- Explored Devils Garden trail early morning
- Photographed Landscape Arch, the longest natural arch in North America
- Witnessed the Milky Way over Double Arch at night

### Canyonlands National Park

- Drove the Island in the Sky scenic drive
- Hiked to Mesa Arch for sunrise (photographers arrive an hour early)
- Marveled at the vastness from Grand View Point
- Took a side trip to Dead Horse Point State Park

## Santa Fe: Culture and Cuisine (Days 11-12)

A welcome shift from natural wonders to cultural experiences:

- Explored the historic Plaza and Palace of the Governors
- Visited Georgia O'Keeffe Museum to understand her connection to the region
- Walked Canyon Road's art galleries
- Feasted on New Mexican cuisine (green chile everything!)

## Taos: Desert Mystique (Day 13)

Just a short drive from Santa Fe but a completely different vibe:

- Toured the 1,000-year-old Taos Pueblo
- Walked across the Rio Grande Gorge Bridge
- Explored the quirky Earthship Biotecture community
- Enjoyed the sunset from our adobe Airbnb

## Essential Road Trip Tips

### Navigation

- **Download offline maps**: Cell service is spotty in many areas
- **Have physical maps as backup**: We used a National Geographic Southwest map
- **Don't trust GPS time estimates**: Factor in photo stops and slower driving on scenic roads

### Reservations

- Book accommodations 3-6 months in advance, especially for national parks
- Reserve popular activities (Antelope Canyon tours, etc.) early
- Many restaurants in popular areas need reservations

### Packing Essentials

- **Wide-brimmed hat and high-SPF sunscreen**
- **Layers**: Desert temperatures fluctuate dramatically
- **Reusable water bottles and a cooler for drinks**
- **Good hiking boots with ankle support**
- **Binoculars for distant views and wildlife**

## Conclusion

The American Southwest offers an incredible diversity of landscapes, from towering rock formations to ancient pueblos. What made our trip special was allowing time to experience each location at different times of day—watching how the light transforms the landscape from dawn to dusk.

If you're planning your own Southwest adventure, my biggest advice is to resist the temptation to see everything. Build in free time, allow for spontaneous detours, and accept that you'll be planning your return trip before this one is even over.
