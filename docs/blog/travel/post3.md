# Land of Fire and Ice: 10 Days Circling Iceland's Ring Road

**Published: April 20, 2023**

Iceland had been at the top of my travel bucket list for years—a land of dramatic contrasts where volcanic landscapes meet glaciers, and geothermal hot springs bubble alongside ice-cold waterfalls. Last September, I finally made the journey, spending 10 days driving the famous Ring Road that circles the country. Here's my experience, complete with tips for planning your own Icelandic adventure.

## Planning Your Iceland Trip

### When to Visit

Each season offers a completely different experience:

- **Summer (June-August)**: 24-hour daylight, better weather, crowded, expensive
- **Shoulder Season (May, September)**: Fewer tourists, reasonable daylight, chance to see Northern Lights
- **Winter (October-April)**: Northern Lights, ice caves, challenging driving conditions, limited daylight

I chose early September and found it ideal—the summer crowds had thinned, prices dropped slightly, and I had 4-5 hours of darkness each night to hunt for the Northern Lights.

### The Ring Road Basics

Iceland's Route 1 (Ring Road) is an 828-mile highway that circles the entire island. While you could technically drive it in 24 hours straight, I recommend at least 7-10 days to enjoy the sights.

My itinerary:
- Day 1-2: Reykjavik
- Day 3: Golden Circle
- Day 4: South Coast to Vik
- Day 5: South Coast to Höfn
- Day 6: East Fjords
- Day 7: North Iceland/Mývatn
- Day 8: North Iceland/Akureyri
- Day 9: Snæfellsnes Peninsula
- Day 10: Return to Reykjavik

### Renting a Car

A crucial decision for any Ring Road trip:

- I rented a 4x4 SUV (Toyota RAV4) with good clearance
- While not necessary for the Ring Road itself, a 4x4 allows access to F-roads and more remote areas
- Automatic transmission is worth the extra cost on Iceland's winding roads
- Consider purchasing full insurance coverage—Iceland's weather is unpredictable

## Reykjavik: Urban Iceland (Days 1-2)

Before hitting the Ring Road, I spent two days exploring Iceland's capital:

- Walked to the iconic **Hallgrímskirkja** church for city views
- Visited the **Harpa Concert Hall** with its stunning glass façade
- Explored local museums including the **National Museum of Iceland**
- Sampled traditional Icelandic cuisine (yes, including fermented shark)
- Took a dip in my first Icelandic swimming pool at **Laugardalslaug**

### Practical Tip

Many Ring Road travelers skip Reykjavik entirely, but I found it valuable to understand Iceland's culture before exploring its nature. Two days was perfect.

## The Golden Circle (Day 3)

While technically not part of the Ring Road, the Golden Circle is a must-do detour:

- **Þingvellir National Park**: Walked between the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates
- **Geysir Geothermal Area**: Watched Strokkur erupt every 5-10 minutes
- **Gullfoss**: Marveled at the massive two-tiered waterfall
- **Secret Lagoon**: A less crowded, more authentic alternative to the Blue Lagoon

### Practical Tip

The Golden Circle gets extremely crowded. I started at 7am and had Þingvellir almost to myself for the first hour.

## The South Coast (Days 4-5)

The south coast offers Iceland's most dramatic and accessible landscapes:

### Day 4 Highlights

- **Seljalandsfoss**: Walked behind this 200-foot waterfall
- **Skógafoss**: Climbed the stairs for a view from above
- **Sólheimajökull**: Took a guided glacier hike
- **Reynisfjara**: Explored the famous black sand beach with basalt columns
- **Overnight in Vik**

### Day 5 Highlights

- **Fjaðrárgljúfur Canyon**: Hiked along the rim of this stunning canyon
- **Skaftafell**: Hiked to Svartifoss waterfall with its unique basalt columns
- **Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon**: Watched icebergs float toward the sea
- **Diamond Beach**: Photographed ice chunks washed up on black sand
- **Overnight near Höfn**, enjoying the best lobster soup of my life

### Practical Tip

The south coast attractions are relatively close together but allow plenty of time for stops. What Google Maps says is a 3-hour drive will take you 6-7 hours with photo breaks.

## The East Fjords (Day 6)

After the popular south coast, the East Fjords felt wonderfully remote:

- Drove winding coastal roads with dramatic views at every turn
- Spotted wild reindeer in the distance
- Explored the charming fishing village of **Seyðisfjörður** with its rainbow street
- Hiked to a remote waterfall where I was the only visitor
- Stayed overnight in a converted farmhouse with a home-cooked meal

### Practical Tip

The East Fjords have fewer "must-see" attractions but offer authentic experiences away from the crowds. Be flexible and willing to make spontaneous stops.

## North Iceland/Lake Mývatn (Day 7)

The North feels like a different world from the South:

- **Dettifoss**: Visited Europe's most powerful waterfall
- **Lake Mývatn**: Explored otherworldly volcanic formations
- **Námafjall Geothermal Area**: Walked among bubbling mud pots and steam vents
- **Mývatn Nature Baths**: Enjoyed a more relaxed alternative to the Blue Lagoon
- **Goðafoss**: Stopped at the "Waterfall of the Gods" at sunset

### Practical Tip

The north has more distance between attractions. Fill up your gas tank whenever possible, and download offline maps as cell service can be spotty.

## North Iceland/Akureyri (Day 8)

- Explored **Akureyri**, Iceland's "Capital of the North"
- Took a whale watching tour from **Húsavík** (saw humpbacks and dolphins)
- Visited the **Arctic Coast Way**, a less-traveled route along the northern shore
- Enjoyed the best hot chocolate at **Kaffi Kú**, a cafe overlooking a dairy farm

### Northern Lights Success!

After checking the aurora forecast daily, I finally saw them on night 8 near Akureyri. I drove away from city lights, set up my camera, and witnessed green and purple lights dancing across the sky for nearly two hours.

Camera settings that worked for me:
- ISO 1600-3200
- f/2.8 aperture
- 15-20 second exposure
- Wide-angle lens (14mm)
- Tripod essential

## Snæfellsnes Peninsula (Day 9)

Often called "Iceland in Miniature," Snæfellsnes offers diverse landscapes:

- **Kirkjufell**: Photographed Iceland's most famous mountain
- **Djúpalónssandur**: Walked the black pebble beach
- **Snæfellsjökull National Park**: Hiked around the glacier that inspired Jules Verne's "Journey to the Center of the Earth"
- **Arnarstapi**: Saw dramatic coastal rock formations
- **Búðakirkja**: Visited the iconic black church

### Practical Tip

The Snæfellsnes Peninsula is doable as a day trip from Reykjavik, but I recommend staying overnight to fully appreciate it.

## Back to Reykjavik (Day 10)

- Made final stops at any missed attractions
- Returned the rental car (no damage, thankfully!)
- Enjoyed one last Icelandic hot dog (surprisingly, one of the country's most beloved foods)
- Picked up last-minute souvenirs

## Essential Iceland Travel Tips

### Budget Considerations

Iceland is expensive. My average daily costs:

- Accommodation: $150-200/night
- Rental car: $100/day (including insurance)
- Fuel: $40-60/day
- Food: $70-100/day (cooking some meals helped save money)
- Activities: Highly variable, from free hikes to $150+ specialized tours

### Weather Preparedness

Iceland's weather changes rapidly. My packing essentials:

- Waterproof jacket and pants
- Layering pieces (thermal base layers, fleece mid-layers)
- Waterproof hiking boots
- Hat, gloves, and wool socks (even in summer)
- Swimsuit for hot springs

### Cultural Tips

- Icelanders speak excellent English but appreciate basic phrases like "takk" (thank you)
- Always shower before entering pools or hot springs (strictly enforced)
- Respect nature by staying on marked paths
- Tipping is not expected or common

## Conclusion

Circling Iceland's Ring Road was one of the most rewarding travel experiences I've ever had. The constantly changing landscapes, friendly people, and sense of adventure made each day memorable.

If you're planning your own Iceland trip, my best advice is to build flexibility into your itinerary. Some of my favorite moments were unplanned stops at unmarked waterfalls or conversations with locals who pointed me toward hidden gems.
